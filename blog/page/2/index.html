      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/08/today-i-saw-the-future/">Today, I saw the future</a></h1>
      <p>Today, we spent most of the day on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington (a short bus ride from downtown Seattle).</p>

<p>The first part of the day was a tour of the Microsoft Envisioning Center. The Envisioning Center is a place where Microsoft can demo technologies that they think will become common in the next 5 &ndash; 10 years.</p>

<p>They have the Envisioning Center divided up into a few different sections, representing the future workspace (i.e. the corporate experience) and a model domestic home.</p>

<p>Probably the most significant change that Microsoft thinks the future will hold is in the proliferation of interoperable touch screens. Our tour guide demoed several scenarios where content on a phone or tablet could be &ldquo;thrown&rdquo; onto a big screen to display to a group or simply to see in a bigger format.</p>

<p>Another cool example was a series of networked digital picture frames scattered throughout the model home. The guide could do things like select a series of photos from a family album and have them rotated throughout the home.</p>

<p>The model kitchen was also really interested. The kitchen had projectors everywhere, allowing recipes to be projected on the the food preparation counter, cooking times projected directly onto the pans as they heat on the stove, and video conference consulting with professional chefs anywhere in the world on a large wall screen.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also making a big push to put Kinect motion sensors everywhere, so that interaction with digital objects becomes really easy. We saw a demo of a virtual potter&rsquo;s wheel: a Kinect was used to quickly scan a pottery flower pot and build a digital model of it. Then that digital model could be virtually reshaped simply by moving your hands in front of the sensor, with the effects showing up on screen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe everything we saw, but if you want to see some of the stuff in the Envisioning Center, Microsoft has a <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2013/03/01/step-inside-the-microsoft-envisioning-center.aspx#.Us40GO5dWoI">video</a> showing some of it.</p>

<p>We also got to meet with Neal Leslie, on the Windows Phone Product Evangelization team. His job is to convince developers to write a version of their apps for Windows Phone. Part of the problem that Windows Phone has faced in competing with Apple&rsquo;s iPhone and phones powered by Google&rsquo;s Android is that in a lot of cases, people choose their platform based on the available apps. Neal said that until recently, for example, the increasingly popular Instagram was only available on iOS and Android. He was directly involved in the process of convincing Facebook (who own Instagram) to write a version of Instagram for Windows Phone.</p>

<p>The third and final person we met with at Microsoft was Dave Maltz. Dave Maltz works in Microsoft Research as an engineer working to develop networking technologies for the next generation of data centers. He gave us a ton of information on how networks are organized and built at a large scale, as well as regaling us with some great stories about mishaps he&rsquo;s witnessed.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/07/visiting-amazon/">Visiting Amazon</a></h1>
      <p>Today was the first full day of my January-term trip (Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley) to the West Coast. We&rsquo;re in Seattle, and this morning we visited Amazon&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>

<p>We met with a guy named Sam. Sam works in the legal operations department, although he isn&rsquo;t a lawyer. We spent about an hour talking with him about what he does, what Amazon does, and how Amazon is looking at the future of its various businesses.</p>

<p>I had a chance to ask Sam about the areas that Amazon is most concerned about in near future (~5 years), and he gave me three issues (with a bonus fourth).</p>

<h4>Privacy and Data Security</h4>

<p>The first was issues of privacy and data security, which is really interesting to me. Amazon obviously has a massive database of user information, including the usual contact and financial information that any e-retailer has, but they also have a vast corpus of information about people&rsquo;s preferences: what they&rsquo;ve bought, when they like to buy, what kinds of stuff they would probably consider buying the future.</p>

<p>Sam used the example of the recent Target breach to show how quickly a brand can be damaged by a security issue. Amazon has yet to have a large-scale data leak, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people aren&rsquo;t trying.</p>

<h4>Antitrust</h4>

<p>A second major concern that Amazon has about the future is a big one (hehe): antitrust. As Amazon gets bigger and bigger, and has its fingers in more and more pies, they are concerned that federal regulators will start to take notice. Sam didn&rsquo;t elaborate on what Amazon is doing to mitigate the risk, but it doesn&rsquo;t take much looking to find lots of examples of the results of past antitrust investigations (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">break-up of Ma Bell in 1982</a>, to the web-browser choice settlements that Microsoft has faced in Europe, or the FTC-blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_purchase_of_T-Mobile_USA_by_AT%26T">attempted acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T</a>).</p>

<h4>Brand Image</h4>

<p>Sam also mentioned that brand image was a major concern of Amazon. They specifically don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;be seen as another Walmart.&rdquo; This really isn&rsquo;t unique, although he tied it strongly to the issue of data security and privacy: a major breach would be devastating to their brand image.</p>

<h4>Labor Relations</h4>

<p>The bonus fourth issue is labor relations. The reason I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s a bonus issue is that Sam mentioned this issue as one he personally thinks will be an area of concern. (In other words, Jeff Bezos probably wouldn&rsquo;t mention it). Basically, Amazon has gotten, and continues to get, a lot of flak over its labor practices.</p>

<p>The aspect of this that I know most about is the concerns over how Amazon treats its hourly employees in its fulfillment warehouses. Called &ldquo;pickers&rdquo;, these employees have to work very long hours in very physically demanding conditions, often for low pay. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor">This</a> article is an interesting description of some of these issues.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2013/07/02/dynamically-load-content-with-jquery/">Dynamically Load Content With jQuery</a></h1>
      <p>This post is more for my reference than anything else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a fairly simple static site, based on Twitter&rsquo;s <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> framework. I don&rsquo;t really want to add the complexity of a templating system or anything like that, but as the site has started to grow, maintaining a bunch of static pages has gotten a little unwieldy (yesterday I caught myself copy-pasting the footer div to 6 different files&hellip;yuck!)</p>

<p>The solution? Dynamically load content that&rsquo;s repeated across a lot of pages, using jQuery.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I did it (I&rsquo;ll use the footer as an example):</p>

<p>First, I put the repeated content into a separate HTML file (<code>footer.html</code>).</p>

<p>Then, on each page I want to have this footer in, I put in an empty div in the place I want the footer to be loaded in:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;footer&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- footer loaded here --&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At the end of the document, I use a jQuery function to load the content of the footer into the current page:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;#footer&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;footer.html&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajaxSetup</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">async</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The call to <code>ajaxSetup</code> with the <code>async: false</code> parameter is optional. I put it in there to try and reduce the visual &ldquo;flicker&rdquo; that happens when the content is loaded after the rest of the page. There&rsquo;s still a small delay, but it&rsquo;s not really noticeable. It&rsquo;s also probably not necessary for a normal footer, since it&rsquo;s likely to be &ldquo;below the fold&rdquo; anyway.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Vi (actually Vim) now for about a year as my primary code-editor. I really don&rsquo;t like using a mouse when I can help
it, so the Vi keyboard-centric philosophy has been a pretty nice change to my workflow. I&rsquo;m by no means a Vi expert, but for most
things I&rsquo;m quicker doing it in Vi than a more GUI based text editor. (I will still sometimes use GEdit or Sublime if I&rsquo;m going to
be doing a lot of copy-paste work).</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ve kind of missed having an actual IDE. Code completion<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is nice, as is symbol-based code navigation. I doubt I even need
to mention how nice an integrated debugger is! I used <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a> <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> as a Java/JavaScript IDE at an internship a year ago, and really fell in love with it. The attention to detail and the level of polish really can&rsquo;t be matched by any of the open source offerings. Since then, I&rsquo;ve also used <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Jetbrains PyCharm</a> for various school projects. PyCharm has the same core and mostly the same interface as IDEA, but with superb Python support baked right in. (PyCharm also has the same JavaScript, HTML, and CSS support that IDEA does, so it&rsquo;s perfect for web development.)</p>

<p>I just discovered that there is an excellent plugin for PyCharm<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that adds really, really comprehensive Vi-style editing. <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164">IdeaVim</a> supports a pretty large subset of Vi commands. In fact, in my (admittedly pretty novice) usage of Vi commands, I have yet to run in to anything I can do in Vi that I can&rsquo;t in PyCharm with IdeaVim.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of supported features (copied from the docs):</p>

      <p>During last week we&rsquo;ve all heard a lot about the previously secret NSA covert surveillance activies. Through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM surveillance program</a>, the NSA has at least some access to a lot of user data from many different Internet services, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others.</p>

<p>In addition to this latest revelation, some already-existing laws have the potential affect the privacy of our Internet communications. For example, the <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/book/export/html/42#node-46">&ldquo;abandoned email&rdquo;</a> provision of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (ECPA) allows the U.S. government to access emails that have not been read in the last 180 days without probable cause and a warrant. This includes previously read emails that may have been archived or otherwise stored, even in a still-active email account.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is a little disconcerting; our Internet communication is less significantly less private that we previously thought.</p>

<p>One of the ways that we can try to protect our privacy is by encrypting email communication. I recently discovered a handy plugin for Google Chrome called <a href="http://www.mailvelope.com">Mailvelope</a>. Mailvelope seamlessly integrates with the Gmail web interface to provide an easy way to encrypt and decrypt your emails using the OpenPGP standard. (It also seems to support Yahoo and Outlook.com, although I didn&rsquo;t try it with those providers).</p>

<p>When you compose an email and then encrypt it with Mailvelope, the text of the email is replaced with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext">ciphertext</a>. This means that even if someone (<em>cough</em> NSA <em>cough</em>) accesses the email from your Gmail account, all they can see is the encrypted message.</p>

<p>When the recipient recieves the email, they will have to decrypt it to see what you sent them. They can either use the Mailvelope plugin also (if they have it installed) or one of many other 3rd-party programs that support OpenPGP messages.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to set up Mailvelope so that you can send and recieve encrypted emails.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2013/06/08/ubuntu-multiple-sessions/">Multiple Ubuntu Unity Sessions</a></h1>
      <p>I often find myself working on several programming projects at once. This generally involves one or more Chrome windows, multiple Vi terminal windows, and miscellaneous text editors, Gimp windows, Evernote pages, etc, all arranged over multiple workspaces (usually the same ones so I can find stuff quickly!).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often wished I could have multiple X sessions running at the same time, completely independent of each other. Then I could have one project open and spread out, while being able to quickly switch to a different project, with its unique set of windows and layout options.</p>

<p>I just discovered that if multiple users are logged in to an Ubuntu machine, it&rsquo;ll put each user&rsquo;s X session in a separate TTY (virtual terminal). The first 6, TTY1 &ndash; TTY6, are console sessions. The first user to log into a graphical session in Ubuntu is on TTY7. If you switch users (Gear menu &ndash;> Switch Users) and log in to a different user account on the computer, it will start that session on TTY8.</p>

<p>Note: TTY&rsquo;s can be accessed by typing <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;tty_num %F%&gt;</code>. So to access TTY8, for example, I would type <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;F8&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I had originally hoped that I could start a separate X session but still log in as my main user account. Unfortuantely, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be possible with Unity &ndash; I can start another X session and log in, and even manually start Unity, but every time I open programs, they appear in the first Unity session, on TTY7.</p>
