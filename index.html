  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally wrote this paper for an interdisciplinary course called Ethics and Technology, during fall 2013.</em></p>

<p>Net neutrality is a term frequently encountered when discussing access to information on the Internet. While it is generally intended to refer to a guarantee of certain qualities of access to the global Internet, it has been specifically defined in many different ways. I intend to ethically analyze the various aspects of net neutrality, including several common definitions. I will contend that a definition of net neutrality that allows for network traffic prioritization and shaping is ethical, but only for the purposes of managing and improving the network. Non-net neutrality is unethical if it is done for financial gain (e.g. “pay extra for the premium sites package”), if it is not transparent to the end user, or is done to discriminate against a particular class of users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, we visited Google headquarters, in Mountain View, California. It was certainly an impressive experience, but I was left with some mixed feelings about the experience.</p>

<p>First of all, Google is obviously doing some really cool stuff. My computer and Internet experience would be very different without Google. I use Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Search, Chrome, and other products every day. Large parts of the Internet are financed by Google-served ads.</p>

<p>Google also has the deep pockets and corporate will to perform groundbreaking research. Their self-driving car is incredible, and Google Glass is pretty revolutionary (whatever you think about the benefit to humanity).</p>

<p>On the other hand, I found myself fairly uncomfortable at many points during our visit yesterday. One of the people we met was Craig Cornelius, a former Luther alumna who works on the internationalization team (i18n) at Google. One of the first things Craig said when he starting talking about Google was, &ldquo;how much do you pay Google to use our services?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fairly innocuous question, but he clearly expected us to answer that we paid nothing.</p>

<p>When someone said that we paid with our personal information, he sort of acknowledged the point, but then immediately moved on to convincing us that because we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;cut Google a check,&rdquo; we really aren&rsquo;t paying anything. That unwillingness to acknowledge Google&rsquo;s core money-maker (our data) leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>I give them that data willingly, in exchange for some very useful services and products. But if Craig&rsquo;s perspective is common at Google, I have to feel like they&rsquo;re simply trying to forget (or convince the rest of us to forget) that we <em>are</em> paying them.</p>

<p>I did enjoying seeing the campus with Charles Banta (a recent Luther grad, and someone I&rsquo;ve worked with at the Luther Tech Help Desk), and getting to see some of the perks that Googlers get. Google clearly views time that employees are not on campus as wasted time. And when you can eat, drink, sleep, get a haircut, get your car repaired, do your laundry, see a doctor, and work out, what&rsquo;s the point of going home?</p>

<p>Again, it would be fun to work at Google, and I know that Charles is really enjoying it. But I can&rsquo;t help but think that your life would quickly become Google-centric. It&rsquo;s one thing to love your job and want to work a lot (a situation I hope to find myself in when I enter the job market), but the word &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; kept popping in to my head during the entire visit. (For a fictional take on this, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18302455-the-circle">The Circle</a> by Dave Eggers. Just replace &ldquo;The Circle&rdquo; with &ldquo;Google&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll have a good idea how I felt visting Google.)</p>

<p>Two of the technical talks we heard, however, were fantastic. Craig Cornelius gave a lecture on the challenges of internationalization of Google products. It didn&rsquo;t sound that interesting at first, but his team has to solve so incredibly difficult projects. How you design projects so that they work equally well with left-to-right AND right-to-left languages? How do you handle keyboard input in a language that has thousands of &ldquo;letters&rdquo;? How do you deal with one of the hundreds of ways a single date and time can be expressed?</p>

<p>We also had a chance to hear a little bit from Brian, an engineer on Google&rsquo;s self-driving car team (unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t manage to catch his last name). We didn&rsquo;t have a chance to get as technical as I would have liked due to time issues, but he had a great introduction to the technology behind the &ldquo;perception suite&rdquo; that&rsquo;s used to make the car &ldquo;see&rdquo;, and some interesting scenarios for possible societal changes that might be caused by the introduction of autonomous cars.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>President Obama gave a speech today. The topic was the NSA; he was addressing the recommendations given by the panel of experts he appointed to review the actions taken by the spy agency.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fairly disappointed in Obama&rsquo;s response. He failed to address or paid only lip service to some pretty important issues.</p>

<h3>Advocate for the defense in the FISA court</h3>

<p>One issue of potential constitutional significance is that cases heard in the secret FISA court are completely one sided: the judges hear only the government&rsquo;s side. The review panel recommended that an advocate be appointed to argue against the government (for the defendants who don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re being considered for surveillance).</p>

<p>In his speech today, President Obama said that he will create a &ldquo;panel of advocates&rdquo; to represent privacy concerns in significant cases.</p>

<p>From The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote><p>A senior official said the advocates would be called on only in cases presenting novel and important privacy law issues. The panel would apparently not have the authority to monitor the court’s caseload and independently decide when a case warranted its presence.</p><footer><strong>The New York Times</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/17/us/nsa-changes-graphic.html'>www.nytimes.com/interactive/01/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>So basically, the &ldquo;advocate panel&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have any power whatsoever. How can the right to counsel be respected if no one has the power to argue against the government? Who decides if a case &ldquo;[presents] novel and important privacy law issues&rdquo;? If the FISA court or the prosecution (i.e. the government/NSA) is responsible for make such a determination, that&rsquo;s hardly better than not having an advocate panel at all!</p>

<h3>Secrecy of National Security Letters</h3>

<p>The other disappointment for me was President Obama&rsquo;s failure to implement the requirement that a judge sign off before a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">national security letter</a> (NSL) can be served. He did change the policy on the mandatory gag orders that stop recipients of NSLs from discussing them or even mentioning that they&rsquo;d received one. The gag orders will now have a fixed expiration date. It&rsquo;s not perfect: he didn&rsquo;t say how long that fixed expiration time period will be (if it&rsquo;s longer than a few months, what&rsquo;s the point?) and the weasel words, &ldquo;in most cases,&rdquo; make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other specific recommendations by the review panel that I think Mr. Obama stopped short of adequately addressing. I&rsquo;d recommend reading the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/17/us/nsa-changes-graphic.html">NYTimes</a> piece &ndash; it does a great job of breaking down his response to each of the recommendations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was our last day here in San Francisco. Tomorrow morning, we&rsquo;re getting on a shuttle down to Palo Alto/Mountain View and the GooglePlex!</p>

<p>This morning, we met with Ann Winblad, of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners. (Ann&rsquo;s VC firm was one of the early funders of Brad&rsquo;s startup, NetPerceptions). Ann is an incredibly engaging speaker, and she gave us a great intro to the world of venture capital, and a lot of description of where she thinks the world of commercial software development is going.</p>

<p>One of Ann&rsquo;s main points is that software development is no longer a task where an isolated startup or other company will write a product from the ground up. Instead, software development comes down to connecting existing components together, leveraging existing corpora of data or databases of prepackaged software components (e.g. Maven).</p>

<p>I found myself thinking about this a lot, and I&rsquo;m still not sure if I totally agree. It&rsquo;s very true that it&rsquo;s easy to build cool pieces of software simply by leveraging other existing software. For example, I&rsquo;m working on a web application that&rsquo;s a prettier, friendlier front end to the Calibre ebook management software. I&rsquo;m (obviously) using the interface exposed by Calibre to get book metadata. I&rsquo;m using Bootstrap to lay out the interface (a designer I am not!). I&rsquo;m using a framework called Angular.js to handle displaying data and updating it easily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, doing this still requires a fair amount of &ldquo;glue&rdquo; code. I have to design a user flow. I have to make sure the right data is shown at the right time. Even with Bootstrap, I have to make at least some effort to make sure it looks decent.</p>

<p>Another perspective on this came from Phillip Alvelda, a serial entrepreneur and scientist, whom we also met with today. Phillip&rsquo;s counterpoint when I mentioned what Ann had talked about was that I should take anything said by a venture capitalist with a grain of salt. They aim to find investments that are low risk and have a very high potential payoff. Designing software that builds on already existing software takes less time and programmer skill (i.e. lower risk) and consequently has a better chance of &ldquo;getting big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phillip&rsquo;s point is that while the type of development Ann favored is a quick way to make money, it&rsquo;s not a good way to truly innovate. Things that require scientific research, or hardware investment, or both, are risky and expensive. While they often have a chance at a huge payoff, venture capitalists are very hesitant to fund such ventures. (Phillip gave the specific example of Elon Musk&rsquo;s now-abandoned hyperloop idea: it had the potential to be extremely innovative, but was expensive and very risky).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also taking what Phillip said about VCs (and Ann Winblad specifically) with a small grain of salt: he mentioned that he&rsquo;s asked Hummer Winblad for investment for three different ventures, and has been turned down all three times&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was a really long day! We visited three groups, all doing very different things.</p>

<p>This morning, we met with a company called Bizo. Bizo does B2B (business to business) Internet marketing. Their customers are other businesses who want to run advertising campaigns on the Internet. They had some interesting perspectives on their business, which is in many ways bigger than a startup but still a pretty small company, but the most interesting part of the conversation for me was in the interview and career advice they had near the end of our visit.</p>

<p>They emphasized that when they interview people, one of their primary concerns (beyond a minimum technical bar) is that the candidate matches their culture. I heard over and over, &ldquo;is this [candidate] someone I would enjoy working with?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but draw comparisons to the way that Matt at VMWare talked about hiring. He was much more concerned about technical ability and problem solving; he said several times that he wanted to work with &ldquo;the smartest people in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brad (our professor) had an interesting perspective on that: the people at Bizo are doing interesting things, but they aren&rsquo;t doing revolutionary or innovative computer science. Their just &ldquo;pushing bits around&rdquo;. On the other hand, VMWare is obviously tackling some very difficult engineering problems. The ablilty of the candidate is much more important than their &ldquo;culture fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We met with some developers from a company called MoovWeb for lunch. MoovWeb&rsquo;s service is one that allows businesses that have an existing complicated desktop web site to convert it to a mobile-friendly version with much less effort than simply re-writing the whole site. It was fun to get a chance to have some informal and in-depth technical discussions with the developers. They&rsquo;re doing some cool stuff with dynamically regenerating sites using a server side architecture (written in Go, no less!)</p>

<p>The last meeting of the day was with a personal finance planner, Sara Ellefsen. Sara works with mostly individuals and families to help them plan and manage their investment portfolio. As a broke college student, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to think about investing and financial planning, but she had some really good advice for how to approach saving and investing, and it was intriguing to see her approach to risk management.</p>

<p>Sara is certainly a (successful) entrepreneur, but of a very different philosophy than many of the startups we&rsquo;ve been meeting with. She doesn&rsquo;t have any employees, and isn&rsquo;t particularly interested in expanding. She likes what she does, and doesn&rsquo;t have grand visions of making millions and starting a global empire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, day 9, we visited Pinterest and Strava.</p>

<p>The first visit was to the Pinterest headquarters in the Soma neighborhood of San Francisco. (If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with Pinterest, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;social pinning&rdquo; site where users can pin pictures, links, and notes about stuff that interests them on virtual bulletin boards.)</p>

<p>We had a chance to meet with John and Dan, two data scientists at Pinterest. As data scientists, they&rsquo;re responsible for analyzing metrics related to the service that Pinterest provides, and making sure that issues are resolved. On a technical basis, that means using things like the R programming language, the Hadoop database engine, and various other analytic tools to measure metrics from user engagement to site reliability to demographic information.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting challenges that Pinterest is facing is how to expand its user base from their historically predominate demographic: American women. They want to change the gender balance to include more men, as well as expanding to more international users.</p>

<p>One of the components of this that Dan and John talked about is that in many ways, they don&rsquo;t really understand exactly why Pinterest is so popular (among women), and so it&rsquo;s very difficult to figure out how to attract more male users. Is it because there isn&rsquo;t enough content that&rsquo;s interesting to a male audience, or is the content there but there just isn&rsquo;t a critical mass of male users?</p>

<p>The other (unrelated) aspect of the Pinterest visit that struck me was their open office layout. Every employee is assigned a small desk as their home. All the desks are out in the open and very close to each other. What this means, especially for programmers who need quiet to concentrate, is that they have to find other places to get real work done. I&rsquo;m skeptical of this approach; it might make collaboration easier occasionally, but as a programmer myself, I think that it would be a death knell for my productivity.</p>

<p>The other company we visited is Strava. Strava makes a service (including a web app and mobile apps for iOS and Android) that allows athletes to track their runs or bike rides. Strava has a social aspect that allows users to compete with themselves and with other users over common routes.</p>

<p>We met with Michael, a co-founder, just-stepped-down CEO, and current president of the board of directors. Michael is an excellent speaker (he used to be a professor&hellip;go figure!) and is clearly passionate about entrepreneurship. He gave a lot of advice, but the piece that resonated most with me was what he said about going to business school (I&rsquo;m sort of applying this to grad school too). He said that if you&rsquo;re interested in starting a company, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t get an MBA. If you do, you&rsquo;ll gain skills and a piece of paper that will make you very desireable to many established companies. More importantly, it will most likely put you in the significant debt. When you graduate with the degree and the debt, going to work for a company that will pay you a safe salary will seem very appealing (and you <em>will</em> be recruited heavily).</p>

<p>Instead, you should just start your company as soon as possible. You can get advice from other people on most aspects, and avoiding the debt incurred in going to business school (or grad school) allows you a lot more options in pursuing your own company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we had our first meetings here in sunny San Francisco. (Seriously, after not seeing the sun for the entire five days in Seattle, it feels like a religious experience to go out for a bike ride in shorts!)</p>

<p>The first group we visited this morning was the PR firm MSL Group, where we met with Bryan Scanlon. Before going in to this meeting, I knew almost nothing about what a public relations firm really does (besides, you know, public relations).</p>

<p>MSL Group is in the top five global PR firms, so they obviously have some pretty big clients. The biggest client that Bryan works with is PayPal, so it was pretty interesting to get a glimpse into what he and the rest of the MSL Group staff do.</p>

<p>One of the things that stood out to me is when someone asked Bryan what kinds of stuff he does when he starts a new campaign or signs a new client. He said that coming up with cool ideas and PR stunts is relatively easy. The hard part is figuring out what effect a particular action has on the customer. Does it help their brand? Does it (accidentally) portray them in a poor light? Does it do anything at all?</p>

<p>Bryan clearly loves his job, and it really came out in his enthusiasm in talking to us. He says that as a PR exec, he has to really learn to know a customer forward, backwards, everything. He has to completely understand their business, their market, their target audience, their challenges, and their image. What this means is that he gets to do wildly different things all the time, and he is always getting to learn new things. One day, he might be writing a blog post for the PayPal corporate blog, while on another day he could be researching the genealogy services market for Ancestry.com.</p>

<p>We also met with Eric Bieller, co-founder of Sqwiggle. Sqwiggle is a startup that&rsquo;s focused on a telepresence solution that&rsquo;s aimed a businesses that want to support remote workers.</p>

<p>Sqwiggle allows a business to have a &ldquo;room&rdquo; that everyone is connected to during the entire day. Each person is represented by a black-and-white still image from their webcam, updated every ten seconds. This provides an at-a-glance check to see if the user is busy, available, etc. From there, it&rsquo;s a matter of clicking on one or more users in the room to start a quick video chat with them. The aim is to replace the action of stopping by a co-worker&rsquo;s cubicle or office to ask them a quick question.</p>

<p>I was a little skeptical at first, but after seeing some impromptu demos, I think I&rsquo;ve been convinced. At a couple of points during our meeting, one of Eric&rsquo;s co-workers pinged him on Sqwiggle. He just said he was busy (or in one case introduced our group) and moved on. The interaction felt really natural and seamless.</p>

<p>Sqwiggle is doing some pretty sweet stuff technically. Their existing product is based on WebRTC with peer-to-peer connections. That stack supports a call with up to four simultaneous users. (The limitation is bandwidth in a P2P setup &ndash; each user has to have a full video stream to every other user). They are working on a federated server model, where they run infrastructure that allows for a conference with more than four users. That system will be based on a Node.js backend.</p>

<p>It was pretty cool to talk with someone as knowledgeable and passionate as Eric. He gave us a lot of really interesting information on the process of forming a tech startup, getting funding from various sources (including AngelList, something I&rsquo;d read about but didn&rsquo;t know a whole lot about), and how (not) to hire early employees.</p>

<p>Apparently, Sqwiggle might be open to hiring interns&hellip;I might just send them an email!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we spent most of the day on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington (a short bus ride from downtown Seattle).</p>

<p>The first part of the day was a tour of the Microsoft Envisioning Center. The Envisioning Center is a place where Microsoft can demo technologies that they think will become common in the next 5 &ndash; 10 years.</p>

<p>They have the Envisioning Center divided up into a few different sections, representing the future workspace (i.e. the corporate experience) and a model domestic home.</p>

<p>Probably the most significant change that Microsoft thinks the future will hold is in the proliferation of interoperable touch screens. Our tour guide demoed several scenarios where content on a phone or tablet could be &ldquo;thrown&rdquo; onto a big screen to display to a group or simply to see in a bigger format.</p>

<p>Another cool example was a series of networked digital picture frames scattered throughout the model home. The guide could do things like select a series of photos from a family album and have them rotated throughout the home.</p>

<p>The model kitchen was also really interested. The kitchen had projectors everywhere, allowing recipes to be projected on the the food preparation counter, cooking times projected directly onto the pans as they heat on the stove, and video conference consulting with professional chefs anywhere in the world on a large wall screen.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also making a big push to put Kinect motion sensors everywhere, so that interaction with digital objects becomes really easy. We saw a demo of a virtual potter&rsquo;s wheel: a Kinect was used to quickly scan a pottery flower pot and build a digital model of it. Then that digital model could be virtually reshaped simply by moving your hands in front of the sensor, with the effects showing up on screen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe everything we saw, but if you want to see some of the stuff in the Envisioning Center, Microsoft has a <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2013/03/01/step-inside-the-microsoft-envisioning-center.aspx#.Us40GO5dWoI">video</a> showing some of it.</p>

<p>We also got to meet with Neal Leslie, on the Windows Phone Product Evangelization team. His job is to convince developers to write a version of their apps for Windows Phone. Part of the problem that Windows Phone has faced in competing with Apple&rsquo;s iPhone and phones powered by Google&rsquo;s Android is that in a lot of cases, people choose their platform based on the available apps. Neal said that until recently, for example, the increasingly popular Instagram was only available on iOS and Android. He was directly involved in the process of convincing Facebook (who own Instagram) to write a version of Instagram for Windows Phone.</p>

<p>The third and final person we met with at Microsoft was Dave Maltz. Dave Maltz works in Microsoft Research as an engineer working to develop networking technologies for the next generation of data centers. He gave us a ton of information on how networks are organized and built at a large scale, as well as regaling us with some great stories about mishaps he&rsquo;s witnessed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was the first full day of my January-term trip (Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley) to the West Coast. We&rsquo;re in Seattle, and this morning we visited Amazon&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>

<p>We met with a guy named Sam. Sam works in the legal operations department, although he isn&rsquo;t a lawyer. We spent about an hour talking with him about what he does, what Amazon does, and how Amazon is looking at the future of its various businesses.</p>

<p>I had a chance to ask Sam about the areas that Amazon is most concerned about in near future (~5 years), and he gave me three issues (with a bonus fourth).</p>

<h4>Privacy and Data Security</h4>

<p>The first was issues of privacy and data security, which is really interesting to me. Amazon obviously has a massive database of user information, including the usual contact and financial information that any e-retailer has, but they also have a vast corpus of information about people&rsquo;s preferences: what they&rsquo;ve bought, when they like to buy, what kinds of stuff they would probably consider buying the future.</p>

<p>Sam used the example of the recent Target breach to show how quickly a brand can be damaged by a security issue. Amazon has yet to have a large-scale data leak, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people aren&rsquo;t trying.</p>

<h4>Antitrust</h4>

<p>A second major concern that Amazon has about the future is a big one (hehe): antitrust. As Amazon gets bigger and bigger, and has its fingers in more and more pies, they are concerned that federal regulators will start to take notice. Sam didn&rsquo;t elaborate on what Amazon is doing to mitigate the risk, but it doesn&rsquo;t take much looking to find lots of examples of the results of past antitrust investigations (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">break-up of Ma Bell in 1982</a>, to the web-browser choice settlements that Microsoft has faced in Europe, or the FTC-blocked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_purchase_of_T-Mobile_USA_by_AT%26T">attempted acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T</a>).</p>

<h4>Brand Image</h4>

<p>Sam also mentioned that brand image was a major concern of Amazon. They specifically don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;be seen as another Walmart.&rdquo; This really isn&rsquo;t unique, although he tied it strongly to the issue of data security and privacy: a major breach would be devastating to their brand image.</p>

<h4>Labor Relations</h4>

<p>The bonus fourth issue is labor relations. The reason I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s a bonus issue is that Sam mentioned this issue as one he personally thinks will be an area of concern. (In other words, Jeff Bezos probably wouldn&rsquo;t mention it). Basically, Amazon has gotten, and continues to get, a lot of flak over its labor practices.</p>

<p>The aspect of this that I know most about is the concerns over how Amazon treats its hourly employees in its fulfillment warehouses. Called &ldquo;pickers&rdquo;, these employees have to work very long hours in very physically demanding conditions, often for low pay. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor">This</a> article is an interesting description of some of these issues.</p>
