      <p>Yesterday, we visited Coloft, a co-working space in Santa Monica. We met with one of the cofounders of Coloft, Avesta Rasouli. Avesta is a serial entrepreneur who had some really interesting thoughts and advice on startups, especially in Silicon Valley. I&rsquo;m just going to talk about of few of the points he made that stood out at me, in no particular order.</p>

<h4>Picking a partner</h4>

<p>Avesta really stressed the importance of picking (a) partner(s) who have/has complementary skill sets. If you&rsquo;re really good at coding, it&rsquo;s pretty important to have someone who can manage a business and make sales (this really echoes the concept of the &ldquo;4 hats of entrepreneurship&rdquo; that we heard from the guys at PerCognate).</p>

<p>According to Avestar, once you have people with complementary skill sets to start a venture with, you have to be willing to stay out of each other&rsquo;s business. You&rsquo;ve got to be willing to trust that the other person (who has skills you don&rsquo;t) knows what their doing. If you try to micromanage everything, the venture is probably going to fail.</p>

<h4>Solve other people&rsquo;s problems, not yours</h4>

<p>This one was interesting for me: Avestar said that it&rsquo;s often important to resist the urge to start something that solves your problems. You need to make sure their&rsquo;s a market for what you&rsquo;re doing (which involves, obviously, talking to people). If you talk to four people, and three of them have the same problem, that might be a good market to go after. If you have a problem you can solve with a product, don&rsquo;t spend a ton of time assuming that other&rsquo;s have that problem: you have to make sure you aren&rsquo;t wasting your time.</p>

<p>I think this is one that I could struggle with. I&rsquo;m obviously not going out and starting a business right now, but when I start projects, they&rsquo;re generally aimed to solve a need I have &ndash; most of what I do wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful to other people.</p>

<h4>Ideas don&rsquo;t mean shit</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ve heard this one a number of times: ideas are a dime a dozen. Everyone has good ideas. It&rsquo;s the execution that takes skill and effort. On a related note, Avestar was pretty dismissive of non-disclosure agreements. He won&rsquo;t sign them in exchange for listening to an idea, and he said that most people in Silicon Valley won&rsquo;t either. This connects to the fact that ideas are cheap: if you have a good idea, telling everyone probably won&rsquo;t make a difference. In fact, someone has already probably had your idea, but wouldn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t execute it. That&rsquo;s what distinguishes an entrepreneur.</p>

<h4>The loudest people are often not the smartest</h4>

<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in how many people follow you on Twitter, or to talk up your ideas and convince people. But the smartest people are the ones who don&rsquo;t waste time with stuff like that: they&rsquo;re actually out building stuff.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/22/sportvision-and-fenwick-and-west/">Sportvision and Fenwick &amp; West</a></h1>
      <p>We&rsquo;ve been on a train now for about nine hours, so you can probably imagine that I&rsquo;m about ready to be done. We should be arriving in Santa Monica in a few hours.</p>

<p>Yesterday was our last day in Menlo Park/Mountain View, and we visited two companies.</p>

<p>The first was Sportvision. Sportvision is one of those companies that you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of, but you&rsquo;ve definitely seen their work. Their technology is responsible for all kinds of &ldquo;virtual reality&rdquo; images on sports broadcast. Their most famous product is the yellow &ldquo;first and ten&rdquo; line that you see superimposed on the field during pro and college football games. They also do graphics and visualizations for hockey, baseball, soccer, basketball, auto racing, and even sometimes skiing. Their biggest area of growth, however, is in data collection. They are putting sensors on players or using cameras to track players, and packaging that data in various different ways to sell to various clients. (The simplest client would be a football team buying the movement and position data for all their players during a game so they can later go back and replay and analyze every play.)</p>

<p>Technologically, this was one of the most sophisticated business we&rsquo;ve seen. All of their work is based on computer vision and motion tracking, so most of their engineers aren&rsquo;t just computer scientists &ndash; they have to have tons of physics and math.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things we saw was a piece of software that can track a baseball (moving at 80-90MPH), and based on it&rsquo;s trajectory, calculate it&rsquo;s spin rate. This is <em>not</em> for the faint at heart.</p>

<p>Even the simple &ldquo;first and ten&rdquo; line isn&rsquo;t nearly as simple as it seems: how do you teach a computer to superimpose the line <em>on</em> the field but <em>below</em> any people or objects on the field? How do you automatically compensate for changing lighting conditions and variable field colors?</p>

<p>We got a great introduction to their business and technology from Michael King, who introduced himself as their director of football, but obviously has a pretty comprehensive view of the whole company.</p>

<p>The other visit we made was to the law firm Fenwick &amp; West, in downtown Mountain View. F &amp; W is a fairly large law firm, but we were meeting with specifically the patent litigation team. They have a ton of large clients, including Twitter, Amazon, and Google.</p>

<p>We had a chance to talk with five lawyers from the patent litigation team, who gave us an extremely well prepared introduction to the basics of patent law, and especially to the problems around patent trolls (TODO add link).</p>

<p>The problems with patent trolls have been well documented, so I won&rsquo;t spend a ton of time talking about them, but I did want to highlight what I thought was the most interesting point made by the F &amp; W team.</p>

<p>The most common proposal for eliminating the problem of patent trolls involves legislation that bans so-called &ldquo;non-practicing entities&rdquo; from owning or legislating based on patents. NPEs are companies who own patents but aren&rsquo;t involved in a business. Obviously, this describes patent trolls: they exist only to purchase patents and sue other companies based on those patents. They don&rsquo;t provide any other product or service.</p>

<p>The problem with such proposed legislation is that, technically, universities are non-practicing entities as well. Nobody wants to argue that what research universities are doing isn&rsquo;t valuable and shouldn&rsquo;t be afforded patent protection. How do you draw the line, though? It&rsquo;s difficult or impossible to draw the line in such a way that it excludes patent trolls while still fairly including universities and other non-profit but still patent-producing institutions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not a lawyer, and I have no idea where to draw the line, but it was incredibly interesting to hear about some of the issues directly from lawyers who have to deal with patent trolls every day!</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m starting a project in Go. The first step was obviously to install Go, but after a half hour wrestling with an old and broken installation and a out-of-date PPA, I got fed up.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gvm">gvm</a>. If you&rsquo;re familiar with rvm for Ruby, I think you&rsquo;re going to like gvm.</p>

<p>Setup on Ubuntu is pretty simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>bash &lt; &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl -s https://raw.github.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you&rsquo;ll need to restart your terminal.</p>

<p>Since the install script seems to assume you&rsquo;re using bash, if you&rsquo;re using a shell other than bash, you&rsquo;ll need to add this to your config file (e.g .zshrc, etc):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[[ -s "$HOME/.gvm/scripts/gvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.gvm/scripts/gvm"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In my case, I wanted the latest version of Go (1.2 as of this writing), so I ran:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>gvm install go1.2
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>gvm use go1.2 --default
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>--default</code> flag sets that particular version of go as the default when you open a new terminal session.</p>

<p>It was fun to see that gvm was written by the devs at <a href="http://www.moovweb.com/">MoovWeb</a>. When I visited them a few days ago I was interested that they were using Go for their backend &ndash; clearly they&rsquo;re pretty invested!</p>

      <p><em>I originally wrote this paper for an interdisciplinary Ethics and Technology course, during the fall of 2013.</em></p>

<p>Net neutrality is a term frequently encountered when discussing access to information on the Internet. While it is generally intended to refer to a guarantee of certain qualities of access to the global Internet, it has been specifically defined in many different ways. I intend to ethically analyze the various aspects of net neutrality, including several common definitions. I will contend that a definition of net neutrality that allows for network traffic prioritization and shaping is ethical, but only for the purposes of managing and improving the network. Non-net neutrality is unethical if it is done for financial gain (e.g. “pay extra for the premium sites package”), if it is not transparent to the end user, or is done to discriminate against a particular class of users.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/18/assimilation-into-the-googleplex/">Assimilation into the GooglePlex</a></h1>
      <p>Yesterday, we visited Google headquarters, in Mountain View, California. It was certainly an impressive experience, but I was left with some mixed feelings about the experience.</p>

<p>First of all, Google is obviously doing some really cool stuff. My computer and Internet experience would be very different without Google. I use Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Search, Chrome, and other products every day. Large parts of the Internet are financed by Google-served ads.</p>

<p>Google also has the deep pockets and corporate will to perform groundbreaking research. Their self-driving car is incredible, and Google Glass is pretty revolutionary (whatever you think about the benefit to humanity).</p>

<p>On the other hand, I found myself fairly uncomfortable at many points during our visit yesterday. One of the people we met was Craig Cornelius, a former Luther alumna who works on the internationalization team (i18n) at Google. One of the first things Craig said when he starting talking about Google was, &ldquo;how much do you pay Google to use our services?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fairly innocuous question, but he clearly expected us to answer that we paid nothing.</p>

<p>When someone said that we paid with our personal information, he sort of acknowledged the point, but then immediately moved on to convincing us that because we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;cut Google a check,&rdquo; we really aren&rsquo;t paying anything. That unwillingness to acknowledge Google&rsquo;s core money-maker (our data) leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>I give them that data willingly, in exchange for some very useful services and products. But if Craig&rsquo;s perspective is common at Google, I have to feel like they&rsquo;re simply trying to forget (or convince the rest of us to forget) that we <em>are</em> paying them.</p>

<p>I did enjoying seeing the campus with Charles Banta (a recent Luther grad, and someone I&rsquo;ve worked with at the Luther Tech Help Desk), and getting to see some of the perks that Googlers get. Google clearly views time that employees are not on campus as wasted time. And when you can eat, drink, sleep, get a haircut, get your car repaired, do your laundry, see a doctor, and work out on campus, what&rsquo;s the point of going home?</p>

<p>Again, it would be fun to work at Google, and I know that Charles is really enjoying it. But I can&rsquo;t help but think that your life would quickly become Google-centric. It&rsquo;s one thing to love your job and want to work a lot (a situation I hope to find myself in when I enter the job market), but the word &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; kept popping in to my head during the entire visit. (For a fictional take on this, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18302455-the-circle">The Circle</a> by Dave Eggers. Just replace &ldquo;The Circle&rdquo; with &ldquo;Google&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll have a good idea how I felt visting Google.)</p>

<p>Two of the technical talks we heard, however, were fantastic. Craig Cornelius gave a lecture on the challenges of internationalization of Google products. It didn&rsquo;t sound that interesting at first, but his team has to solve so incredibly difficult projects. How you design projects so that they work equally well with left-to-right AND right-to-left languages? How do you handle keyboard input in a language that has thousands of &ldquo;letters&rdquo;? How do you deal with one of the hundreds of ways a single date and time can be expressed?</p>

<p>We also had a chance to hear a little bit from Brian, an engineer on Google&rsquo;s self-driving car team (unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t manage to catch his last name). We didn&rsquo;t have a chance to get as technical as I would have liked due to time issues, but he had a great introduction to the technology behind the &ldquo;perception suite&rdquo; that&rsquo;s used to make the car &ldquo;see&rdquo;, and some interesting scenarios for possible societal changes that might be caused by the introduction of autonomous cars.</p>

      <p>President Obama gave a speech today. The topic was the NSA; he was addressing the recommendations given by the panel of experts he appointed to review the actions taken by the spy agency.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fairly disappointed in Obama&rsquo;s response. He failed to address or paid only lip service to some pretty important issues.</p>

<h3>Advocate for the defense in the FISA court</h3>

<p>One issue of potential constitutional significance is that cases heard in the secret FISA court are completely one sided: the judges hear only the government&rsquo;s side. The review panel recommended that an advocate be appointed to argue against the government (for the defendants who don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re being considered for surveillance).</p>

<p>In his speech today, President Obama said that he will create a &ldquo;panel of advocates&rdquo; to represent privacy concerns in significant cases.</p>

<p>From The New York Times:</p>

<p>So basically, the &ldquo;advocate panel&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have any power whatsoever. How can the right to counsel be respected if no one has the power to argue against the government? Who decides if a case &ldquo;[presents] novel and important privacy law issues&rdquo;? If the FISA court or the prosecution (i.e. the government/NSA) is responsible for make such a determination, that&rsquo;s hardly better than not having an advocate panel at all!</p>

<h3>Secrecy of National Security Letters</h3>

<p>The other disappointment for me was President Obama&rsquo;s failure to implement the requirement that a judge sign off before a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">national security letter</a> (NSL) can be served. He did change the policy on the mandatory gag orders that stop recipients of NSLs from discussing them or even mentioning that they&rsquo;d received one. The gag orders will now have a fixed expiration date. It&rsquo;s not perfect: he didn&rsquo;t say how long that fixed expiration time period will be (if it&rsquo;s longer than a few months, what&rsquo;s the point?) and the weasel words, &ldquo;in most cases,&rdquo; make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other specific recommendations by the review panel that I think Mr. Obama stopped short of adequately addressing. I&rsquo;d recommend reading the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/17/us/nsa-changes-graphic.html">NYTimes</a> piece &ndash; it does a great job of breaking down his response to each of the recommendations.</p>

      <p>Today was our last day here in San Francisco. Tomorrow morning, we&rsquo;re getting on a shuttle down to Palo Alto/Mountain View and the GooglePlex!</p>

<p>This morning, we met with Ann Winblad, of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners. (Ann&rsquo;s VC firm was one of the early funders of Brad&rsquo;s startup, NetPerceptions). Ann is an incredibly engaging speaker, and she gave us a great intro to the world of venture capital, and a lot of description of where she thinks the world of commercial software development is going.</p>

<p>One of Ann&rsquo;s main points is that software development is no longer a task where an isolated startup or other company will write a product from the ground up. Instead, software development comes down to connecting existing components together, leveraging existing corpora of data or databases of prepackaged software components (e.g. Maven).</p>

<p>I found myself thinking about this a lot, and I&rsquo;m still not sure if I totally agree. It&rsquo;s very true that it&rsquo;s easy to build cool pieces of software simply by leveraging other existing software. For example, I&rsquo;m working on a web application that&rsquo;s a prettier, friendlier front end to the Calibre ebook management software. I&rsquo;m (obviously) using the interface exposed by Calibre to get book metadata. I&rsquo;m using Bootstrap to lay out the interface (a designer I am not!). I&rsquo;m using a framework called Angular.js to handle displaying data and updating it easily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, doing this still requires a fair amount of &ldquo;glue&rdquo; code. I have to design a user flow. I have to make sure the right data is shown at the right time. Even with Bootstrap, I have to make at least some effort to make sure it looks decent.</p>

<p>Another perspective on this came from Phillip Alvelda, a serial entrepreneur and scientist, whom we also met with today. Phillip&rsquo;s counterpoint when I mentioned what Ann had talked about was that I should take anything said by a venture capitalist with a grain of salt. They aim to find investments that are low risk and have a very high potential payoff. Designing software that builds on already existing software takes less time and programmer skill (i.e. lower risk) and consequently has a better chance of &ldquo;getting big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phillip&rsquo;s point is that while the type of development Ann favored is a quick way to make money, it&rsquo;s not a good way to truly innovate. Things that require scientific research, or hardware investment, or both, are risky and expensive. While they often have a chance at a huge payoff, venture capitalists are very hesitant to fund such ventures. (Phillip gave the specific example of Elon Musk&rsquo;s now-abandoned hyperloop idea: it had the potential to be extremely innovative, but was expensive and very risky).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also taking what Phillip said about VCs (and Ann Winblad specifically) with a small grain of salt: he mentioned that he&rsquo;s asked Hummer Winblad for investment for three different ventures, and has been turned down all three times&hellip;</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/15/bizo/">Bizo, MoovWeb, and Sara Ellefsen</a></h1>
      <p>Today was a really long day! We visited three groups, all doing very different things.</p>

<p>This morning, we met with a company called Bizo. Bizo does B2B (business to business) Internet marketing. Their customers are other businesses who want to run advertising campaigns on the Internet. They had some interesting perspectives on their business, which is in many ways bigger than a startup but still a pretty small company, but the most interesting part of the conversation for me was in the interview and career advice they had near the end of our visit.</p>

<p>They emphasized that when they interview people, one of their primary concerns (beyond a minimum technical bar) is that the candidate matches their culture. I heard over and over, &ldquo;is this [candidate] someone I would enjoy working with?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but draw comparisons to the way that Matt at VMWare talked about hiring. He was much more concerned about technical ability and problem solving; he said several times that he wanted to work with &ldquo;the smartest people in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brad (our professor) had an interesting perspective on that: the people at Bizo are doing interesting things, but they aren&rsquo;t doing revolutionary or innovative computer science. They&rsquo;re just &ldquo;pushing bits around&rdquo;. On the other hand, VMWare is obviously tackling some very difficult engineering problems. The ablilty of the candidate is much more important than their &ldquo;culture fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We met with some developers from a company called MoovWeb for lunch. MoovWeb&rsquo;s service is one that allows businesses that have an existing complicated desktop web site to convert it to a mobile-friendly version with much less effort than simply re-writing the whole site. It was fun to get a chance to have some informal and in-depth technical discussions with the developers. They&rsquo;re doing some cool stuff with dynamically regenerating sites using a server side architecture (written in Go, no less!)</p>

<p>The last meeting of the day was with a personal finance planner, Sara Ellefsen. Sara works with mostly individuals and families to help them plan and manage their investment portfolio. As a broke college student, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to think about investing and financial planning, but she had some really good advice for how to approach saving and investing, and it was intriguing to see her approach to risk management.</p>

<p>Sara is certainly a (successful) entrepreneur, but of a very different philosophy than many of the startups we&rsquo;ve been meeting with. She doesn&rsquo;t have any employees, and isn&rsquo;t particularly interested in expanding. She likes what she does, and doesn&rsquo;t have grand visions of making millions and starting a global empire.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/01/14/pinterest-and-strava/">Pinterest and Strava</a></h1>
      <p>Today, day 9, we visited Pinterest and Strava.</p>

<p>The first visit was to the Pinterest headquarters in the Soma neighborhood of San Francisco. (If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with Pinterest, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;social pinning&rdquo; site where users can pin pictures, links, and notes about stuff that interests them on virtual bulletin boards.)</p>

<p>We had a chance to meet with John and Dan, two data scientists at Pinterest. As data scientists, they&rsquo;re responsible for analyzing metrics related to the service that Pinterest provides, and making sure that issues are resolved. On a technical basis, that means using things like the R programming language, the Hadoop database engine, and various other analytic tools to measure metrics from user engagement to site reliability to demographic information.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting challenges that Pinterest is facing is how to expand its user base from their historically predominate demographic: American women. They want to change the gender balance to include more men, as well as expanding to more international users.</p>

<p>One of the components of this that Dan and John talked about is that in many ways, they don&rsquo;t really understand exactly why Pinterest is so popular (among women), and so it&rsquo;s very difficult to figure out how to attract more male users. Is it because there isn&rsquo;t enough content that&rsquo;s interesting to a male audience, or is the content there but there just isn&rsquo;t a critical mass of male users?</p>

<p>The other (unrelated) aspect of the Pinterest visit that struck me was their open office layout. Every employee is assigned a small desk as their home. All the desks are out in the open and very close to each other. What this means, especially for programmers who need quiet to concentrate, is that they have to find other places to get real work done. I&rsquo;m skeptical of this approach; it might make collaboration easier occasionally, but as a programmer myself, I think that it would be a death knell for my productivity.</p>

<p>The other company we visited is Strava. Strava makes a service (including a web app and mobile apps for iOS and Android) that allows athletes to track their runs or bike rides. Strava has a social aspect that allows users to compete with themselves and with other users over common routes.</p>

<p>We met with Michael, a co-founder, just-stepped-down CEO, and current president of the board of directors. Michael is an excellent speaker (he used to be a professor&hellip;go figure!) and is clearly passionate about entrepreneurship. He gave a lot of advice, but the piece that resonated most with me was what he said about going to business school (I&rsquo;m sort of applying this to grad school too). He said that if you&rsquo;re interested in starting a company, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t get an MBA. If you do, you&rsquo;ll gain skills and a piece of paper that will make you very desireable to many established companies. More importantly, it will most likely put you in the significant debt. When you graduate with the degree and the debt, going to work for a company that will pay you a safe salary will seem very appealing (and you <em>will</em> be recruited heavily).</p>

<p>Instead, you should just start your company as soon as possible. You can get advice from other people on most aspects, and avoiding the debt incurred in going to business school (or grad school) allows you a lot more options in pursuing your own company.</p>
